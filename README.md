## Home network internet bonding with Speedify
A router OS for easy bonding setup using Speedify as the main gateway with OpenWRT without command line usage. <br>Not affiliated with Speedify or Connectify.<br>
<br>
Use case: 
- Use Speedify as an SDN bonding VPN to cover all connected devices in a home network when it's not possible or practical to share a WAN per device.  
- Build a reliable internet access with seamless failover, lossless and usable single-flow speeds by bonding two or more connections, preferably a combination of wired and wireless with baseline ISP plans.

- Head to Status->Overview: <br>
<img src="https://github.com/TalalMash/SmoothWAN-web/raw/main/Basic%20Setup%20Guide%20assets/7.png" width="300"/> <br>
- You will be greeted with the Speedify app, login: <br>
<img src="https://github.com/TalalMash/SmoothWAN-web/raw/main/Basic%20Setup%20Guide%20assets/8.png" width="300"/> <br>
- Connect and configure a Wi-Fi AP/router if needed, the internal Wi-Fi of the RPi4 is poor for general use, connect using RPi4's Ethernet port to a configured AP/router [(more info)](https://github.com/TalalMash/SmoothWAN/discussions/18#discussioncomment-2521688): <br>
<img src="https://github.com/TalalMash/SmoothWAN-web/raw/main/Basic%20Setup%20Guide%20assets/2a.svg" width="300"/> <br>
- After switching over to Wi-Fi AP/router, head over to Network->Wireless (Basic) and disable Pi's Wi-Fi: <br>

<summary>Speedify solutions in Q2 2022</summary>

- Relatively affordable and does not require setting up a server. <br>
- Includes optimization for non-streaming services.  <br>
- Instant server region selection for region restricted services and multiple backup pubilic servers. <br>
- SDN VPN: By having one exit IP address, connected network sessions are uninterrupted and implements flow control: sensitive streams packets are duplicated across WANs and prioritized for VoIP, video calls, streaming, and games for seamless failover and lossless connectivity even when combining lossy WANs. While non-sensitive streams packets are aggregated across WANs for the speed of the total combined WANs, and bulk downloads using single sockets are aggregated. Sensitive streams are also aggregated with high quality sources. <br>
- Per WAN quality rating system that's based on jitter, latency, stability, and speed variations over a period of time to prevent an unstable WAN from impacting total aggregation performance. e.g WAN resume and suspend delay is increased on multiple failures, poor connections will be removed from aggregation and used for backup etc. <br>
- Per WAN VPN transport protocols for optimal connectivity when used with strict ISPs or poor middleboxes, used protocols: HTTPS(disguises as web browsing), UDP, TCP, TCP Multiple. <br>
- "TCP Multiple" transport protocol as known as parallel transfer sockets similiar to threaded download managers allows maximum speed to be achieved on high latency, lossy, and far region VPN servers (with loss based CCA host settings and out-of-order packets). Also circumvents poor ISP restrictions. <br>
- Quick packet aggregation weighing for largely asymmetric and heterogenous WANs. Slowly adapts to speed variations when using cellular/wireless. <br>
- No out of order packet delivery on aggregation, needed for single socket TCP connection performance. <br>
- An option for using a WAN for speed boosts only and backup only mode, data consumption usage depends on primary WAN quality rating in backup mode for seamless failover. <br>
- Switching critical settings such as protocols, modes, and adding or removing WANs without disruption. <br>
- TCP transport modes implements pacing for low RTT and low TCP-over-TCP overhead. <br>
