## Home network internet bonding with Speedify
Setup Speedify as a gateway using OpenWRT without command line usage. <br>Not affiliated with Speedify or Connectify.<br>
<br>
Typical use case examples: 
- Use Speedify as a VPN to cover all connected devices in a home network when it's not practical to share a WAN.
- Access to a reliable internet with usable speeds in a rural area with poor connectivity by bonding at least 2 connections with Speedify, preferably a combination of wired and wireless. Speedify is optimized for livestreaming and mixed usage, most services are optimized for livestreaming only (2022).

- Head to Status->Overview: <br>
<img src="https://github.com/TalalMash/SmoothWAN-web/raw/main/Basic%20Setup%20Guide%20assets/7.png" width="300"/> <br>
- You will be greeted with Speedify app, login: <br>
<img src="https://github.com/TalalMash/SmoothWAN-web/raw/main/Basic%20Setup%20Guide%20assets/8.png" width="300"/> <br>
- Navigate to settings, and enable "Connect at Startup": <br>

- Time to connect and configure a Wi-Fi AP/router if needed, the internal Wi-Fi of the RPi4 is poor for general usage, connect using RPi4's Ethernet to a configured AP/router: <br>
<img src="https://github.com/TalalMash/SmoothWAN-web/raw/main/Basic%20Setup%20Guide%20assets/2a.svg" width="300"/> <br>
- After switching over to Wi-Fi AP/router, head over to Network->Wireless (Basic) and disable internal Wi-Fi: <br>

<summary>Speedify compared to current consumer-grade bonding solutions</summary>
  
- SDN VPN: By having one exit IP address when bonding, connected network sessions are uninterrupted. Sensitive streams are mirrored across WANs and prioritized for VoIP, video calls, streaming, and games for seamless failover and lossless connectivity even when combining lossy WANs. While non-sensitive streams are aggregated across WANs for the speed of the total combined WANs, and bulk downloads using single sockets are aggregated. Sensitive streams are also aggregated with high quality sources. <br>
- Per WAN quality rating system that's based on jitter, latency, stability, and speed variations over a period of time to prevent an unstable WAN from impacting total aggregation performance. (e.g will suspend a WAN on multiple failures, resume and suspend delay is increased on multiple failures) <br>
- Per WAN VPN transport protocols for optimal connectivity when used with strict ISPs or poor middleboxes, used protocols: HTTPS(disguises as web browsing), UDP, TCP, TCP Multiple. <br>
- "TCP Multiple" transport protocol as known as parallel transfer sockets allows maximum speed to be achieved on high latency, lossy, and far region VPN servers (with loss based CCA host settings and out-of-order packets). <br>
- Automatic packet aggregation weighing for largely asymmetric and heterogenous WANs. Slowly adapts to speed variations when using cellular/wireless. <br>
- No out of order packet delivery on aggregation. <br>
- An option for using a WAN for speed boosts only and backup only mode, data consumption usage depends on primary WAN quality rating in backup mode for seamless failover. <br>
- Switching critical settings such as protocols, modes, and adding or removing WANs without disruption. <br>
- TCP transport modes implements pacing for low bufferbloat and low RTT for thin streams. <br>
- Instant server region selection for region restricted services. <br>
- Relatively affordable and does not require setting up a server. <br>

<summary>Advanced: Build from source using OpenWRT's imagebuilder</summary>
  - Grab your imagebuilder device target archive from: https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/21.02.1/targets/ <br>
  - Clone repo and copy the corresponding device from devconfigs and packages to imagebuilder root. <br>
  - Run "sh build.sh" <br>
  - Images will be located in bin/<device target> <br>
  - Note: For compiling SmoothWAN packages, compile smoothwan-feeds with OpenWRT build system. Pre-compiled packages are included for easy customization, quick builds and imagebuilder-only setup. <br>
